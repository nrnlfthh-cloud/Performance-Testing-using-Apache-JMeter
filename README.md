# Performance-Testing-using-Apache-JMeter
For testing web applications, JMeter is one of the popular open-source performance testing tools. One of its benefits is that it can simulate a high load with many virtual users. Multiple test types (Load, Stress, Spike, Soak) are supported and there is also non-GUI mode for effective high-load performance.
